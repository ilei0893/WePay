// this file exports everything from this folder as a bulk so we dont have to export each component one by one.
// example if you want to export:
// import { Sidebar, something, something } from  "../components";

export { default as EmployeeSidebar } from  './EmployeeSidebar/EmployeeSidebar';
export { default as EmployeeHeader } from  './EmployeeHeader/EmployeeHeader';
export { default as EmployeeTable } from  './EmployeeTable/EmployeeTable';
