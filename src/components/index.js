// this file exports everything from this folder as a bulk so we dont have to export each component one by one.
// example if you want to export:
// import { Sidebar, something, something } from  "../components";

export { default as Sidebar } from  './Sidebar/Sidebar';
export { default as Header } from  './Header/Header';
export { default as EmployeeMenu } from  './EmployeeMenu/EmployeeMenu';
export { default as EmployeeTable } from  './EmployeeTable/EmployeeTable';
